### Representative Work

**Minishell**  
Implemented a Unix-like shell featuring a tokenizer, parser, pipe execution, redirection handling, and environment management. Focus on process control, deterministic resource cleanup, and robust handling of malformed input.

**get_next_line**  
Low-level read layer with controlled buffering, zero-leak memory semantics, and predictable time complexity. Demonstrates discipline in pointer management and incremental data assembly.

**libft**  
Foundational library replicating key standard functions with attention to edge consistency, portability, and predictable performance.

### Engineering Mindset  
Think in invariants and edge cases · Measure before optimizing · Prefer simplicity over cleverness · Write code that is auditable and predictable under stress

---

### Current Growth Areas  
Distributed systems and consistency models · Concurrency and synchronization primitives
