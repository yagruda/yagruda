## Hi there 👋
Backend-focused engineer with strong foundation in systems programming, algorithmic thinking, and practical software engineering. I create dependable, maintainable, well-organized systems that scale consistently and function properly under challenging circumstances.


Technical Profile 
• C, C++, Python, JS, SQL 
• HTML, CSS, SASS, GULP
• Systems programming on Linux: processes, signals, file descriptors, I/O 
• Clean architecture and modular design 
• Focused on Algorithmic efficiency
• Experience with Git-based workflows and systematic code reviews 
• Understanding of distributed backend patterns and service reliability

Representative Work

Minishell
Implemented a Unix-like shell featuring a tokenizer, parser, pipe execution, redirection handling, and environment management. Focus on process control, deterministic resource cleanup, and robust handling of malformed input.

get_next_line
Low-level read layer with controlled buffering, zero-leak memory semantics, and predictable time complexity. Demonstrates discipline in pointer management and incremental data assembly.

libft
Foundational library replicating key standard functions with attention to edge consistency, portability, and predictable performance.

Engineering Mindset
	•	Think in invariants and edge cases
	•	Measure before optimizing
	•	Prefer simplicity over cleverness
	•	Write code that is auditable and predictable under stress
	•	Treat correctness as a baseline expectation, not a goal

Current Growth Areas
	•	Distributed systems and consistency models
	•	Concurrency and synchronization primitives
	•	Networked services and protocol-level understanding
	•	Profiling and latency reduction strategies
	•	Cloud-native service patterns
